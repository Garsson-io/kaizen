# Kaizen — Continuous Improvement Plugin

Standalone Claude Code plugin for recursive process improvement. Works on any project.

## Quick Context

Kaizen provides enforcement hooks, reflection workflows, and dev workflow skills. Host projects configure via `kaizen.config.json`. Kaizen uses kaizen on itself (self-dogfood).

## Skills

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| `/kaizen-reflect` | Post-work reflection — classify impediments, file issues |
| `/kaizen-pick` | Select next issue from backlog |
| `/kaizen-gaps` | Strategic analysis — tooling gaps, horizon concentration |
| `/kaizen-evaluate` | Scope gate — evaluate issue before implementation |
| `/kaizen-implement` | Spec-to-code executor |
| `/kaizen-deep-dive` | Autonomous root-cause fix across a category |
| `/kaizen-audit-issues` | Taxonomy audit — label coverage, epic health |
| `/kaizen-prd` | Problem mapping — iterative discovery to spec |
| `/kaizen-plan` | Break large work into sequenced PRs |
| `/kaizen-review-pr` | Self-review checklist |
| `/kaizen-write-pr` | Write a PR body using the Story Spine narrative arc |
| `/kaizen-dimensions` | List, inspect, and manage review battery dimensions |
| `/kaizen-file-issue` | Fast incident-to-issue capture (2 min) |
| `/kaizen-zen` | Print the Zen of Kaizen |
| `/kaizen-wip` | Show in-progress work |
| `/kaizen-cleanup` | Disk usage analysis and safe cleanup |
| `/kaizen-setup` | Install & configure plugin for a host project |
| `/kaizen-update` | Pull updates from kaizen repo |

## Mandatory Practices

**PR bodies**: Always use `/kaizen-write-pr` when creating or editing PR descriptions. Never write a bare `gh pr create --body` with a few bullet points. The Story Spine narrative makes PRs reviewable without reading the diff.

**PR review dimensions**: When running `/kaizen-review-pr`, bundle dimensions by shared data needs (use the briefing from `npx tsx src/cli-dimensions.ts briefing --lines N`). Don't spawn one agent per dimension — batch dims with identical `needs` into single agents.

## Configuration

All skills and hooks read `kaizen.config.json` from the host project root:

```bash
KAIZEN_REPO=$(jq -r '.kaizen.repo' kaizen.config.json)
HOST_REPO=$(jq -r '.host.repo' kaizen.config.json)
```

## Development

```bash
npm install          # Install deps
npm run build        # Compile TypeScript
npm test             # Run TS tests
npm run test:hooks   # Run shell hook tests
```

## Testing — Behavioral vs Structural

Some things CANNOT be tested with unit tests or grep patterns:
- **SKILL.md / prompt changes** — the "code" runs inside Claude's context. The only real test is `claude -p` with the skill invoked in a `SyntheticProject`.
- **Issue routing / config-dependent behavior** — must be tested in a realistic host project context where `KAIZEN_REPO != HOST_REPO`.
- **Hook interaction flows** — must simulate the full event sequence, not just one hook in isolation.

Use `Garsson-io/kaizen-test-fixture` as the host repo for E2E tests. Never test against real user repos. See `src/e2e/setup-live.test.ts` and `src/e2e/issue-routing.test.ts` for patterns.

**Kaizen is a plugin for host projects.** Every skill, hook, and test must work when `KAIZEN_REPO != HOST_REPO` (host project mode), not just when they're equal (self-dogfood mode).

## The Three Levels

- **L1 (Instructions):** CLAUDE.md, SKILL.md, docs. No enforcement.
- **L2 (Hooks):** Automated checks that block actions. Deterministic.
- **L3 (Mechanistic):** Built into architecture. Can't be bypassed.

When L1 fails, escalate to L2. When L2 is bypassed, escalate to L3.

## Issue Routing (Three-Way)

Kaizen reflections produce three types of insights:
1. **Meta-kaizen** — improving kaizen itself → file in kaizen repo
2. **Host-kaizen** — improving the host project → file in host repo with `kaizen` label
3. **Generalized pattern** — reusable lesson → file in kaizen repo with `type:pattern` label
